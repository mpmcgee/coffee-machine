# coffee-machine
An OOP coffee machine simulator in Java. Functions include buying a coffee drink, refilling the machine with supplies, taking money out of the machine, and checking supplies.


## Purpose
This is a brief simulation of a coffee maker to practice implementing abstract classes. Each coffee drink is a subclass of the abstract class Coffee. Once instantiated, these objects are used to represent drinks that are made for the customers and update the supplies in the machine after each sale.
